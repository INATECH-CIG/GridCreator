# GridCreator
Automatically generate synthetical yet realistic distribution networks based on open data

The GridCreator is a tool for automated generation of synthetic low-voltage networks based on open data. Currently we use data from
- ding0
- OpenStreetMap (osm)
- Zensus 2022
- Marktstammdatenregister

The tool builds up on existing projects and databases and combines them in a single tool to cover the whole pipeline from choosing an area and timerange to having a fully parametrised distribution grid.
This is achieved in five steps, that can either be executed individually or subsequently (see also LINK):
- Step 1: load grid data from ding0 for specified coordinates
- Step 2: Load sozio-economic data from census for the specified coordinates and attach them to network nodes
- Step 3: Load data on installed units for specified coordinates; distribute PV, Battery Storage, EVs and Heat Pumps according to socio-economic correlations from Step 2 to all nodes in the network
- Step 4: Include weather data and generate time series for PV generation, demand and Heat Pump operation based on this. Also generate profiles for occupancy and EV availability
- Step 5: Prepare the network for optimization with PyPSA
