# GridCreator
Automatically generate distribution networks based on open data

The aim is to build a tool for automated generation of synthetic low-voltage networks based on open data such as
- open street map (osm)
- Zensus 2022
- Marktstammdatenregister

The tool builds up on existing projects and databases and combines them in a single tool to cover the whole pipeline from choosing an area and timerange to having a fully parametrised distribution grid.
The output distribution grid will contain
- lines, buses, substations
- households and installed technologies
- timeseries for renewable generation
- timeseries for household electricity demand (loads, electric vehicles, heat-pumps)
- industrial and commercial users and installed technologies
- timeseries for industrial heat demand, electricity demand and generation
